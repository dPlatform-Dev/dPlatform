# dPlatform

### WHY dPLATFORM?
They said "If you don't like how big tech operates their social media then build your own"... so I did!

dPlatform is a decentralized, censorship resistant, self-moderated, self-monetizing, social media online digital publishing and discussion platform for open ideas and open dialogue where your right to share information, think differently, and disrupt the mainstream narratives are protected.

And the best part, that isn't just a politicians', bureaucrats', or corporate executives' promise...instead it’s a cryptographic one, backed by real things like math and code and stuff.

Those who have power only have it because we've given it to them. Take back your power by making a different choice, choose self-empowerment, choose dPlatform.

dPlatform Yourself!

### PROBLEM WITH EXISTING PLATFORMS
Centralization - The content you contribute to existing platforms whether "big tech" or new arrivals is ultimately governed by the "business decisions" of corporate boards, lawyers, middle managers, moderation teams, and developer algorithms. Despite what virtue they might signal, flag they may fly, acronym they may promote, or fair-weather trend they may follow, advertisers are their customers, ad dollars are their revenue stream, and shareholder earnings are their masters.

Lack of Transparency - Is shadow banning real or a myth? Is a certain group or ideology favored over another? How would you know? Existing platforms hide behind intellectual property, proprietary business practices, and non-disclosure agreements.

Censorship - Should a private business be forced to host content it deems inappropriate, offensive, or not aligned with its brand or business objectives? Censorship has no place in a society that aspires to freedom, empowerment of the individual, and a democratic process. Existing platform are private businesses not the public square and therefore not required to provide free speech!

Narrative Control - When does "content moderation" become propaganda and narrative control? When the government controls private businesses we call it totalitarianism. When private business entities control the government, we call it fascism. What do we call it when a government intelligence agency provides seed round investment money to startup companies that later become the dominant information platforms? What do we call it when those same information platforms are "weaponized" against foreign populations to create social instability and "soft" regime change? How would you know if those same information platforms were being weaponized against you and your neighbors?

Monetization by Paid Speech (Advertising) - Who clicks on ads? Who watches and doesn't skip them? Who doesn't use ad blockers or the Brave Browser? If the existing platforms required a monetary payment, would you still use them? If so, would you still expect and accept ads? Would you expect them to still collect your activity and sell your private data? Content that generates an emotional response generates more views and impressions and sells more ads. So, when the existing platforms aren't censoring content or controlling the narrative for the power group, they are pushing content that generates more advertising dollars from their paying customers, the advertising industry. Collectively $600 billion (USD) is spent on advertising per year, "paid speech" to tell you whatever they are selling is the bestest best, so go buy it!

You're The Product Not The Customer - Who doesn't like free stuff? Even better, who doesn't like doing minimal "real work", contributing nothing of lasting value to society, filling the empty void inside themselves with other people’s attention, and getting paid with advertising dollars for all the likes, subscribes, follows, views, impressions, and clicks? Before all the "unboxing" content creators, video game streamers, wannabe talking heads, and clickbait fake news channels object...is the "freemium" advertising $$$ monetization model, which requires the tracking, collecting, and sale of all your fans' and followers' online behavior and data the ONLY way for you to get paid? Are there no other monetization models?

### HOW dPLATFORM SOLVES THESE PROBLEMS
Decentralization - The content you contribute is hosted on the nodes (miners) of the ArWeave network, current count is between 500 and 1000 geographically distributed nodes. Each node/miner operator individually determines what data they will host and what data they will not. Node operators are incentivized by a one-time network fee with the original transaction to store your data. See the ArWeave project for more details. At a future date the ownership and development of dPlatform will be transfer to a DAO.

Transparency - The content you contribute is represented by a public cryptocurrency (AR) transaction on the ArWeave network. The transaction, if successful, is visible, immutable, and non-reversible on the AR blockweave. At a future date the source code for dPlatform will be open sourced and publicly posted.

Censorship Resistant - The technical features of the ArWeave network (decentralization, transparency, and immutability) make the content you contribute as censorship resistant as currently possible.

Self-Monetization - The content you contribute is monetized by AR microtransaction instead of advertising, membership fees, or paywalls.

True Neutrality - With censorship resistance and self-monetization, narrative control becomes more difficult as dissenting voices have a platform and the marketplace or community decides what gets heard. dPlatform aspires to be a public square composed of a community with varied interests, diverse voices, and open minds not a single private entity monetizing a monolithic platform.

Your Content IS the Product - The content you contribute should sell itself! The content you contribute should compel other to contribute. The content you contribute should be true to you not an advertising trend, marketing executive’s whim, virtue signaling moderator team lead, or community guidelines and standards document. The content you contribute should put more money in your pocket and less in the lobbyist and politicians of the big tech companies and their real customers the advertising industry.
